#### Android App for Mountain Hikers

### App Description

Problem: <br/>
Mountain hiking is a popular leisure time activity. Many people love hiking but they face some difficulties when they want to find the best route to their destination, weather report of the location in the day of hiking, a place to stay, easiest way to get back home etc.

Solution: <br/>
My idea is to devolop an android app for mountain hikers which has the following features: <br/>
- select best places for hiking <br/>
- give brief information of the selected place <br/>
- route to the destination <br/>
- give the elevation details of their location <br/>
- weather report of the particular location on that day and <br/>
- suggest nearest lodges, bus stops, railway stations, shops, medical centers etc.
